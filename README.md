# Optimize Animal Tranquilizer Aiming System<br>
Term project for the course: *Neural Netwroks and Deep Learning*. This project emphasizes on improving the tracking of animals in real time to make sure that the tranquilizer accurately aims at the target<br> 
The dataset used is [Oxford IIIT Pets dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/). The dataset itself contains the respective maskings.<br>

For which we have developed an model to track the motion of the animal.<br> By masking the animal to represent the trace of the tracking achieved by our model.     
We have worked with Three models namely:<br>1.Simple Unet  <br> 2.Unet CNN<br> 3.FPN with ResNet34    
The respective Evaluation plots

In order to showcase the result we use images and videos to prove its effectiveness.<br>
